## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you landed here because I challenged your "Rewrite in Rust, when?" or "Use Rust / write everything in Rust, because MEMORY SAFETY" question and feel offended, I got news for you:
I'm not a troll.
It is sad to see people defaulting to the troll assumption when being challenged - Wake up!

Rust is not gonna save modern software enginering, on the contracty it is an entangled mess of unnecessary complexity. "But you don't understand Rust / Have you ever written Rust?"
I spent over a year disecting the Rust compiler and wrttien several utilities in Rust to try out the language.
The conclusion is, it isn't contributing anything significant and doesn't offer anything beneficial over other programming languages. As a matter of fact, languages like Modern Object Pascal or ADA is much more beneficial to use, given it's solid language design without compromising its ease of use and quick to learn.
